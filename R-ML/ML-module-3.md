## ML-module-3
Hello and welcome to the third module on Machine Learning.
In this module we will learn about Regression.


## Regression
The term regression is used when you try to find the relationship between variables.
In Machine Learning, and in statistical modeling, that relationship is used to predict the outcome of future events.
There are three types of Regression in Machine Learning: 
Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Multiple Regression.


## Linear Regression
Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.
This line can be used to predict future values.
So How Does it Work?
Python has methods for finding a relationship between data-points and to draw a line of linear regression.


## Polynomial Regression
If your data points clearly will not fit a linear regression (a straight line through all data points), it might be ideal for polynomial regression.
Polynomial regression, like linear regression, uses the relationship between the variables x and y to find the best way to draw a line through the data points.
How Does it Work?
Python has methods for finding a relationship between data-points and to draw a line of polynomial regression.


## Multiple Regression
Multiple regression is like linear regression, but with more than one independent value, meaning that we try to predict a value based on two or more variables.
How Does it Work?
In Python we have modules that will do the work for us. Start by importing the Pandas module.


## Conclusion
Thank you.
