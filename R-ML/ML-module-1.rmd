## Data Set
Data Set<br />
In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.<br />

Example of an array:<br />

[99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

## Data Types
Data Types <br />
To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with. <br />

We can split the data types into three main categories: <br />

- Numerical <br />
- Categorical <br />
- Ordinal
