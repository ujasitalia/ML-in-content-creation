## ML-module-1
Hello and welcome to the second module on Machine Learning.

## Mean
The mean value is the average value.
To calculate the mean, find the sum of all values, and divide the sum by the number of values:
(99+86+87+88+111+86+103+87+94+78+77+85+86) / 13 = 89.77.
The NumPy module has a method for this.
Use the NumPy mean() method to find the average speed

## Mean, Median, and Mode
In this module we will learn how to calculate mean, median and mode.
What can we learn from looking at a group of numbers?
In Machine Learning (and in mathematics) there are often three values that interests us:
Mean - The average value.
Median - The mid point value.
Mode - The most common value.

## Median
The median value is the value in the middle, after you have sorted all the values:
77, 78, 85, 86, 86, 86, 87, 87, 88, 94, 99, 103, 111.
It is important that the numbers are sorted before you can find the median.
The NumPy module has a method for this.
Use the NumPy median() method to find the middle value.
If there are two numbers in the middle, divide the sum of those numbers by two.


## Mode
The Mode value is the value that appears the most number of times:
99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86 = 86.
The SciPy module has a method for this.
Use the SciPy mode() method to find the number that appears the most

## Conclusion
Thank you.
