## ML-module-1
Hello and welcome to the first module on Machine Learning.

## Machine Learning
So firstly we will learn what is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).
Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

## Data Set
Now we will learn what is a dataset. 
In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.

## Data Types
To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with.
We can split the data types into three main categories: Numerical, Categorical, Ordinal.
Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories: Discrete Data.
- numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by. Continuous Data.
- numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item
Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.
Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.

## Conclusion
Thank you.
