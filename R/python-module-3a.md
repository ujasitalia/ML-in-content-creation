## Python module 3a
Hello and welcome to the third module on Python.
In this module of Python we will learn about the if else statement and about while and for loops.

## Python If ... Else
Python Conditions and If statements.
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

## Python While Loops
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
Example:
Print i as long as i is less than 6:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
  
## Python For Loops

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages. 
With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

## Conclusion
Thank you.
