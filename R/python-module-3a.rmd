Less than: a < b <br />
Less than or equal to: a <= b <br />
Greater than: a > b <br />
Greater than or equal to: a >= b

## Python While Loops
Python While Loops <br />

Example <br />
Print i as long as i is less than 6: <br />

i = 1 <br />
while i < 6: <br />
  print(i) <br />
  i += 1

## Python For Loops
Python For Loops <br />
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

Example <br />
Print each fruit in a fruit list: <br />

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br />
for x in fruits: <br />
  print(x)
