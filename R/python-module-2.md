## Python module 2
Hello and welcome to the second module on Python.

## Python Data Types
In this module we will learn about various data types in Python.Built-in Data Types: In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things. Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories: Text Type:	str Numeric Types:	int, float, complex. Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range. Mapping Type:	dict Set Types:	set, frozenset. Boolean Type:	bool Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview.

## Python Numbers
Now we will learn about Python numbers.
There are three numeric types in Python: int, float, complex. Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:  Example x = 1  -> # int, y = 2.8 ->  # float, z = 1j -> # complex.

## Strings
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. 'hello' is the same as "hello". You can display a string literal with the print() function:
  
## Python Lists
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. Lists are created using square brackets: Example, Create a List: thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], print(thislist).

## Tuple
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Tuples are written with round brackets.

## Python Dictionaries
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and does not allow duplicates. As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered. Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values.

## Conclusion
Thank you.
