## Python module 4
Hello and welcome to the fourth module on Python.
In this module we will learn about file handling.

## File Handling
File handling is an important part of any web application.
Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.
The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.
There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:
  
## Python File Open
To open the file, use the built-in open() function.
The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file. 

## Python File Write
To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:
"a" - Append - will append to the end of the file.
"w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content.

## Python Delete File
To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its os.remove() function.

## Conclusion
Thank you.
