## Python module 1
Hello and welcome to the first module on Python.

## What is Python?
So firstly we will learn what is Python.
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
Python is used for:web development (server-side),software development,mathematics,system scripting.

## Python Syntax
Secondly we will learn about Python syntax. So typing print and Hello world in brackets will print Hello world. In the second example, Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.vWhere in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

## Creating a Comment

Comments can be used to explain Python code. Comments can be used to make the code more readable. Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

## Variables

Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

## Conclusion
Thank you.
